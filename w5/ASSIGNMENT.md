Week 5 - Tue Apr 5th @7:30 '22

During this last week, we found it hard to understand how xv6 was implemented so this week we'll take a detour to get some better insight into the inner workings of xv6, especially the scheduler and interrupts, two topics that we have just covered in OSTEP.

Also, no one had finished the lottery scheduler assignment from the week before, so I'm pushing it out another week to give people a chance to finish it after the reading.

Finally, next week, class will be at 7:30pm instead of 7pm.

- Read chapters 3 (Traps, Interrupts and Drivers) and 5 (Scheduling) of the [xv6 book](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/xv6/book-rev11.pdf)
- Finish the lottery scheduler (and write some tests or draw a graph)
- [Extra Credit] exercises in the xv6 book
