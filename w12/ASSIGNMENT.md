**Week 12 - Tue May 31st @7:00 '22**

This is the start the 2nd of 3 Easy Pieces, Concurrency.  This section is much shorter than the previous (Virtualization).  We are close to halfway through the book.  This week is another 2 chapters, with the homework from each chapter.  Ch. 27 has some coding homework.  We again use valgrind to identify errors in our code, this time with threads instead of invalid memory.

Reading:

- Read Ch. 26 Concurrency and Threads
- Read Ch. 27 Thread API

Homework:

- Ch. 26 Simulation
- Ch. 27 Code
