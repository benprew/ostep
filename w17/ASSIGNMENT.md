**Week 17 - Tue Aug 2nd @7:00 '22**

Continuining with the persistence topic. There is simulation homework in ch. 38, but I think the chap 39 homework is more interesting (and there's only so much you can talk about with RAIDs).

Reading:

- Ch. 38 RAIDs
- Ch. 39 Files and Directories

Homework:

- Ch. 39 Code Homework
