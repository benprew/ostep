# OSTEP self-paced learning

My book group is going through [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/).  The answers and assignments for each week are in the corresponding wX folders (where X is the number of the week).

Our plan is:
* Follow the book in order, try to get through 2-3 chapters a week
* Focus on coding homework and some projects, simulation mostly optional

This should have us finishing the book in ~20 weeks, but maybe longer depending on how involved some of the chapters are.

Week 1 didn't have any assignments.
